This document outlines the high level ideas behind the Unified Internal Model and Collective Intelligence concepts. These concepts describe patterns of coherence stability and group behavior in distributed systems. The focus is on observing patterns such as alignment drift and stability across nodes. No algorithms formulas or internal computation methods are included. This document is conceptual and does not reveal any implementation details.
