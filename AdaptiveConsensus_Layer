This document provides a high level conceptual overview of an adaptive consensus layer that responds to coherence and stability information in distributed systems. All descriptions focus on system behavior categories, not implementation.

Examples of adaptive responses may include:
Adjusting influence weight of nodes
Isolating or sandboxing unstable participants
Increasing priority of coherent behavior
Reducing impact of drift-prone nodes
General adaptive routing based on stability signals

These descriptions illustrate only the types of actions a consensus layer might take. No algorithms, weighting formulas, thresholds, or mechanisms are included. No functional logic is disclosed.

All proprietary consensus methods, internal computation structures, and adaptive algorithms remain private and owned exclusively by Tyson A Miller.
