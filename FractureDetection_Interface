This document outlines high level categories of events that a distributed system might acknowledge when monitoring for fracture, drift, or instability. These categories are conceptual only and do not describe detection mechanics or algorithms.

Example event categories may include:
Role or function changes
Sudden instability patterns
Alignment or coherence drops
Unexpected behavior shifts
General drift indicators

These categories are illustrative placeholders meant to show the types of signals a system may classify. They do not include thresholds, rules, calculations, or internal logic. No detection engine or methodology is revealed.

All proprietary detection logic, scoring methods, and computational structures remain private and owned exclusively by Tyson A Miller.
